        There are many small businesses that could benefit from the design or redesign of a website to promote the business. This site is designed to exhibit the talents, abilities, and thinking of the developers. The intent is to convince business owners that this team is creative, skilled, and capable of producing a site not only specific to a particular business, but also unique for that business.
        <br/><br/>
        In this case, the demonstration site uses a restaurant as an example. To exhibit creativity by making the site unique, an ability to use the site to search local events through Ticketmaster is included. The thinking being that people who are thinking of a night out might use this site to find an event and book a reservation all at one site. A Google Maps insert assists visitors to find the business location and relate that to event locations. As a further draw, the ability to display information on the calorie count of any meal or individual side-dish is also included. There is a page on the site that is not customer facing, but is intended for the use of staff to look up ingredients, build meals, and then to recall those items for listing on the menu.
        <br/><br/>
        The site includes the use of HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for the layout and client-side logic. Three APIs are involved - Google Maps for location, Ticketmaster for events, and Nutritionix for calories.
        <br/><br/>
        The Kitchen page was my contribution to this project. This included all of the HTML, the layout of the page, the JavaScript for querying the Nutritionix API, and the logic behind the user interface and experience.
