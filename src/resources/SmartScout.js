            This project provides a browser-based system to allow a professional sports team to gather information on athletes, organize that data, and display meaningful information for the team to use in evaluations - such as for drafting college athletes or pursuing free agents. In this demonstration example, the sport is football and the team is the Panthers. Future possibilities include adapting the site for other sports, for use by colleges, and possibly use in other fields.
            <br/><br/>
            The site includes the use of HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, CSS Grids, and JavaScript for the layout, Password for the log in, MongoDB and Mongoose for the database, and Express and NodeJS for the server. React was used for the presentation slides on the About page.
            <br/><br/>
            My part in this included work on the initial site design (file structure and organization) and providing the About page using React. The slide background with text overlay was produced using Corel PaintShop Pro.
